The coder overhead is high to correctly manage the calloc/free code that was being used in this code before. A switch to vectors decreases that burden without having to change any of the code that accesses the actual array elements. Now that we have C++11 at our command, are there good reasons not to use vectors consistently for local data structures?\n",

That made it look clumsy. Also, the memory class has provisions for allocating memory with a preferred alignment and is integrated into the error reporting when malloc fails. When using C++ features you would also have to wrap everything into try/catch blocks to cleanly handle memory allocation issues and shut down parallel runs cleanly. My take on using containers is: we use them only when we can take advantage of their additional features, e.g. use iterators, or the size() member function (in case the size is unknown) or want to add/remove elements incrementally. What to use also depends on the specific use case. You can see that in the use of the tokenizer class (for speed) or the utils::split_words() function (for consistency and convenience).\n",
